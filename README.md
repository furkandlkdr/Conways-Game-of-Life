## Conway's Game of Life Rules:

- **Survival:** A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors will continue to live.
- **Death:** A live cell with fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors will die (due to underpopulation or overpopulation).
- **Birth:** A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors will be reborn.

## About Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life, often simply called "Life", is a cellular automaton created by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution depends entirely on the initial pattern. Despite its simple rules, Life displays incredible complexity and emergent behavior. It became popular after appearing in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column, and continues to fascinate mathematicians, computer scientists, and hobbyists alike.
